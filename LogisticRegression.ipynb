    "This Machine learning Algorithm is used for **Classification Problems** which means the y value is in the form of categorical data (binary or multi-class). **Logistic regression** predicts the probability of an outcome that can only have two values (i.e. a dichotomy). The prediction is based on the use of one or several predictors (numerical and categorical). A linear regression is not appropriate for predicting the value of a binary variable because:\n",
    "- A linear regression will predict values outside the acceptable range (e.g. predicting probabilities\n",
    "outside the range 0 to 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, a logistic regression produces a logistic curve, which is limited to values between 0 and 1. Logistic regression is similar to a linear regression, but the curve is constructed using the natural logarithm of the “odds” of the target variable, rather than the probability. Moreover, the predictors do not have to be normally distributed or have equal variance in each group.\n"

    "There are several analogies between linear regression and logistic regression. Just as ordinary least square regression is the method used to estimate coefficients for the best fit line in linear regression, logistic regression uses **maximum likelihood estimation (MLE)** to obtain the model coefficients that relate predictors to the target. After this initial function is estimated, the process is repeated until LL (Log Likelihood) does not change significantly. "
